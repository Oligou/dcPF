Code for the article: 
O. Gouvert, T. Oberlin, C. FÃ©votte "Recommendation from Raw Data with Adaptive Compound Poisson Factorization"

The code is implemented in Python 2.7.

The repository contains:

- Models: the algorithms for the models described in the article, namely discrete compound Poisson factorization (dcPF), for different choices of element distributions: logarithmic (dcpf_Log), zero-truncated Poisson (dcpf_ZTP), shifted geometric (dcpf_Geo), shifted negative binomial (dcpf_sNB).

- Dataset: the subset of the Taste Profile dataset used in the article.

- script_dcpf_TPS.py is the script used for the experiments of the article.

- demo_dcpf.py is a small example of application of dcPF on synthetic data. 

- In "function", you can recover a code borrowed from Dawen Liang, to calculate the scores.
